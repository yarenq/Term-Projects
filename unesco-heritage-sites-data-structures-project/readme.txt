This project implements a data structure system to organize and manage UNESCO World Heritage Sites based on their names. The project utilizes various data structures, including Binary Search Trees (BST), Hash Tables, and Heaps, to efficiently store, retrieve, and manipulate the data.

Features
Binary Search Tree (BST)
Constructs a BST from UNESCO World Heritage Sites, ordered by site names.
Extracts descriptive text for each site and stores words in a generic list.
Implements methods to:
Determine the tree depth.
List all site details.
Count the total number of nodes.
Calculate the ideal depth of a balanced BST.
Retrieve site names within a given alphabetical range.
Convert the BST into a balanced BST.
Hash Table Implementation
Stores UNESCO sites in a hash table using their names as keys.
Supports name updates for any given site in the hash table.
Heap Implementation
Implements a Min Heap using an array or list.
Inserts all site names into the heap based on alphabetical order.
Extracts and displays the top three alphabetically ordered sites.
