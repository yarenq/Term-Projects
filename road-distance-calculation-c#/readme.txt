This project utilizes the Turkish General Directorate of Highways' Intercity Distance Table to compute and analyze distances between 81 cities in Turkey using a jagged array representation.

Features
Distance Matrix Construction
Creates a jagged array storing distances between all 81 cities.
Stores city names in an array indexed by license plate numbers.
Distance Querying
Lists cities within a given distance from a selected city.
Provides example outputs for different cities and distances.
Finding Extreme Distances
Identifies the closest and farthest city pairs based on the dataset.
Maximum Reachable Cities
Determines the maximum number of cities that can be visited within a given distance from a selected city.
Implements an algorithm to find the longest possible travel path.
Random City Distance Display
Selects 5 random cities and displays their distance matrix.
